*Weather App*
This is a simple weather app created as a project for The Odin Project curriculum.

Live Version
A live version of the project can be accessed here: 

Benefits
One of the main benefits of working on this project was that it helped me gain a better understanding of how to use asynchronous code. 
By using asynchronous code, I was able to make requests to the OpenWeatherMap API and retrieve weather information without blocking the main thread.

Features
The app allows users to:

Search for weather information for any location
View current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather description
Forecast information is unavailable due to limitations imposed by the free version of the API

The following technologies were used to build this app:

HTML
CSS
JavaScript
OpenWeatherMap API

Credits
The design and layout of the app were inspired by: https://dribbble.com/search/weather-app
